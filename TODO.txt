Omakase is a language for developing large web applications.
- interop with the browser DOM and JS (importing/exporting/inline JS)
- types - non-optional, largely inferred rather than declared
- targeted syntax/semantic fixes (classes, 'this' binding, ...)
- async programming (await/async)
- logical vs. physical code organization
  - logical: namespaces/modules
  - physical: units of distribution/download (think pinto modules)
- debugging (via source maps)
- IDE - code browsing, refactoring?
